# Layer 1 - Physical

This extends to [OSI 7 Layer Model, 20230810175926](../20230810175926/README.md)

Layer 1 represents physical mediums. It is for transmission and reception of
raw bit streams. It defines stuff like voltage levels, rates, distances, timing etc.

A physical medium can be electrical, light or radio frequencies.

Hub the networking device can be given as an example. Hub is basically primitive
version of network switches. Anything received/transmitted on a port can also
be received/tranmistted on other ports which means every package gets sent to
every device on the network, so it is not ideal security wise. This
is because of lacking device addressing in a unique way, like an IP or MAC
address.
