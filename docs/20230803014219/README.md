# Why Zettelkasten? 

A big portion of professions solely rely on knowledge these days, called white collars.
Thus making white collars, knowledge workers as we know it. And of course,
knowledge comes at a price. Knowledge is a highly processed & curated information.
Managing it should be done in same fashion so that you can leverage it efficiently.

Zettelkasten steps in at this point. Unlike traditional note taking which you go
`record and keep` route, Zettelkasten focuses on keeping notes connected like a web.
Each note is highly likely to connect to another one. And the reason for that is,
aiming a structured & organized way of recording thoughts of one. So you can have 
a much cleaner look at a large topic with the help of small, modular thoughts.
Just like other `second brain` solutions such as obsidian and notion. 

All these things aside, why Zettelkasten and not Obsidian or alike? Because of limits.
Obsidian is cool and stuff but also it is proprietary which brings you 
a big scale of dependency. Can't self-host it so you have to rely on someone else's 
server to keep your notes on cloud, other than keeping local. And connections of
notes are not built on a standard(?). Also it's more like a tool whereas Zettelkasten
is a system. Apples to pears kind of issue, you see. Last but not least, a system is
more likely to be customized with ease rather than a proprietary/closed-source tool.

One is not superior to other. Zettelkasten can be flexible and can be used across 
various environments as long as you have an editor. However, Obsidian is bound to
its own app and visual representation. Zettelkasten may require more personal
attention and intervention to process while Obsidian can be more straightforward to use.
Mind your needs, read and watch about both, tinker for sometime and then decide.
Pick one once and for all before your notes get larger in quantity.
