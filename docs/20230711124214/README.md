# Keep a blackbook for commands

I am starting to think keeping a blackbook for commands might be a good idea, actually. Having an easy to reach list of Unix commands along with some personal notes (and maybe not only commands, also extras) can boost one's productivity rather than searching for what you want and trying to pinpoint it on the web.
