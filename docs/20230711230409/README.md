# OVA and OVF extensions

TLDR: They are kinda same.

OVA and OVF are open virtualization formats for ready-to-use virtual machine setups. If you export your own setup to OVF, two seperate files will be exported. On the other hand, OVA consists of only one file which is more practical. However, no documentation ever exists to mention about having both files exported in only one file -in format of OVA-, when exporting your own setup. If that's what you're looking for, just switch file extension manually from OVF to OVA. Sounds ridiculous but works just fine, plus you get fully bundled file into one.
