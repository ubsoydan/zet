# Public vs Private vs Multi vs Hybrid Cloud

Public clouds are open to general public and can be used by anyone
as the name implies.

Private clouds are to use cloud services in-house and provided by
cloud companies. Hosted on on private servers. 

Multi clouds are a mix of public clouds. Generally used for meeting
business needs from two or more clouds that one or another does not
provide certain service.

Hybrid clouds are a mix of private and public clouds. Mostly preferred
for keeping sensitive data on-premises, and the rest goes to public cloud.
However, this model is not a mix of public cloud and on-prem servers.
