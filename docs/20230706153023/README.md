# Computers were originally multi-user

Computers were meant to be used within multi-user system, sharing system files among the users so necessity of having seperate OSes were eliminated. Personal computers were not a thing back then.

This is also why `home` directory exist. System files were seperated and placed one level above of all user files to sustain seperation of concerns and security stuff (due to permissions). Some contests like picoCTF are hosted under a UNIX system which 35K+ users are concurrently connected to and use it.

It was not until some accountants decide to not paying hundreds of dollars to run some spreadsheet numbers on an app called `visicalc`. It was considered such a revolutionary app that it caused a revolution all by itself, making people to buy hardware only to be used for `visicalc` which ended up emerging personal computers.
