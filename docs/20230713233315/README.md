# Ex and Vi are the same

Text editors, ex and vi are the same programs. They are multi call binaries which basically means the binary files that gets executed when you call them are the same file. Soft links are different but hard link that points out the path of binary file in the inode table is no different between the two. See inode table index for the proof.
