# the BLACKBOOK

-   `sudo /sbin/dhclient` triggers dhcp client to assign another IP (multiple IPs possible), can be used if bridged network failed assigning one automatically.

-   `command -v file` is same as `which`

-   `set -o vi` vi keybindings option for shell

-   `stty -a` teletype config listing - looks a bit like primal version of `screen` and `tmux`, also reminds me why `nano` is awful
